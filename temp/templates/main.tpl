<h2>Welcome to the TShock Web Administration panel!</h2><br /><br />

<p>The TShock Web Administration panel provides a web based interface
for admins to interface with the TShock Terraria server.  Please keep in
mind that in order for you to interact with the server you must have
the RestAPI turned on and it must be accessible through the firewall.</p><br /><br />

<p>The TShock Web Administration Panel also has a built in log parser that will
monitor your logs and automatically display alerts to you in the bottom right
hand corner of the page.</p><br /><br />

<p>In order to execute a command on the server, you must select the server from
the right hand side of the screen, and select a command from the left side of the
screen.  All data and feed back will be displayed here.</p>
